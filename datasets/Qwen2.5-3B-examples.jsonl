{"problem":"Let $x$ and $y$ be the legs of a right triangle, where $y = x + 10$. According to the Pythagorean theorem, $x^2 + (x+10)^2 = z^2$, where $z$ is the hypotenuse. Simplifying this yields $2x^2 + 20x + 100 = z^2$. For the triangle inequality to hold, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Thus, $x + (x + 10) > z$, $x + z > x + 10$, and $(x + 10) + z > x$. Since $z$ is the hypotenuse and the longest side, the inequality $x + z > x + 10$ is automatically satisfied because $z > 10$. We need to find integer solutions for $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy these conditions and where the perimeter $P = x + y + z$ can be expressed as the sum of two consecutive integers, $P = n + (n + 1)$, where $n$ is an integer. This implies $P = 2n + 1$, meaning the perimeter must be odd. Given $y = x + 10$, $P = x + (x + 10) + z = 2x + 10 + z$. To find suitable $x$ and $z$, we must solve $2x^2 + 20x + 100 = z^2$ for integers, considering the constraints. This is a form of Pell's equation, and solving it requires finding the integer solutions that make $z$ an integer. Once $x$ and $z$ are determined, we can find $y$ and thus $P$. The perimeter $P$ must not only satisfy the geometric conditions but also be expressible as $2n + 1$.
