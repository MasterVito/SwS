As a critical expert in educational problem design, evaluate the following problem components:

=== GIVEN MATERIALS ===
1. Problem:
{PROBLEM}


=== EVALUATION CRITERIA ===
Rate each criterion as: [Perfect | Acceptable | Bad]

1. FORMAT
- Verify correct implementation of markup tags:
  <!-- BEGIN RATIONALE --> [design thinking process] <!-- END RATIONALE -->
  <!-- BEGIN PROBLEM --> [problem] <!-- END PROBLEM -->

2. FACTUAL ACCURACY
- Check for any incorrect or misleading information in both problem and rationale
- Verify mathematical, scientific, or logical consistency


3. SOLVABILITY
- Verify if the problem has at least one valid solution
- Check if all necessary information for solving is provided

=== RESPONSE FORMAT ===
For each criterion, provide:
1. Rating: [Perfect | Acceptable | Bad]
2. Justification: Clear explanation for the rating

=== FINAL VERDICT ===
After providing all criterion evaluations, conclude your response with:
'Final Judgement: [verdict]'
where verdict must be one of:
- 'perfect' (if both FACTUAL ACCURACY and SOLVABILITY are Perfect, at least two other criteria are Perfect, and no Bad ratings)
- 'acceptable' (if no Bad ratings and doesn't qualify for perfect)
- 'bad' (if ANY Bad ratings)

Note: The 'Final Judgement: [verdict]' line must be the final line of your response.
