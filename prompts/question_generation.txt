### Given a set of foundational mathematical concepts, a mathematical domain, and a specified difficulty level, generate a well-constructed question that meaningfully integrates multiple listed concepts and reflects the stated level of complexity.

### Foundational Concepts:
{CONCEPTS}

### Target Difficulty Level: 
{DIFFICULTY}

### Mathematical Domain: 
{CATEGORY}

### Instructions:
1. Begin by outlining which concepts you will combine and how you plan to structure the question.
2. Ensure that the question is coherent, relevant, and appropriately challenging for the specified level.
3. The question must be a single standalone problem, not split into multiple sub-questions.
4. Do not generate proof-based, multiple-choice, or true/false questions.
5. The answer to the question should be expressible using numbers and mathematical symbols.
6. Provide a final version of the question that is polished and ready for use.

### Output Format:
- First, provide your brief outline and planning for the question design.
- Then, present **only the final version of the question** in the following format:

```text
[Your developed question here]
```
Do not include any placeholder, explanatory text, hints, or solutions to the question in the output block.
