As an expert in educational assessment, analyze this problem:
<problem>
{PROBLEM}
</problem>

Break down and identify {num_concepts} foundational concepts being tested. List these knowledge points that:

- Are core curriculum concepts typically taught in standard courses,

- Are precise and measurable (not vague like "understanding math"),

- Are essential building blocks needed to solve this problem,

- Represent fundamental principles rather than problem-specific techniques.

Think through your analysis step by step, then format your response as a Python code snippet containing a list of {num_concepts} strings, where each string clearly describes one fundamental knowledge point.
